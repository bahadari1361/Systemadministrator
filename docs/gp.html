    <h3>Enterprise Group Policy Implementation in Active Directory</h3>
    <p><strong>Company:</strong> Central Bank of Afghanistan</p>
    <p><strong>Duration:</strong> March 2016 – August 2021</p>

    <p>
      As part of a strategic initiative to enhance security, standardization, and administrative efficiency across the Central Bank of Afghanistan’s IT infrastructure, I led the full design and implementation of a centralized <strong>Group Policy Object (GPO) architecture</strong> within the organization’s Active Directory environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      The project began with a comprehensive assessment of existing policies and system behavior. I performed a full audit of legacy GPOs and organizational units (OUs), identifying conflicts, redundancies, and policy gaps. Based on this, I developed a new GPO structure aligned with Microsoft best practices and ISO/IEC 27001 compliance requirements.
    </p>

    <p>
      Key implementations included:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Creation of tiered Organizational Units (OUs) for users, endpoints, and server roles</li>
      <li>Design of security-focused GPOs for password policies, account lockout, and local group restrictions</li>
      <li>Implementation of BitLocker drive encryption enforcement policies on all endpoints</li>
      <li>Configuration of Windows Update policies using WSUS integration for centralized patch management</li>
      <li>Control of removable media (USB, external drives) through GPO and registry lockdowns</li>
      <li>Standardization of user desktop environments and taskbar configurations</li>
      <li>Automation of GPO reporting and backup using PowerShell scripts</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      To ensure scalability and maintainability, I documented every GPO and its associated settings, created version-controlled backups, and implemented naming conventions and link order strategies. I also trained junior system administrators on managing GPOs and troubleshooting policy inheritance issues.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Technologies Used:</strong><br>
      Windows Server 2012 R2 / 2016 · Active Directory · Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) · PowerShell · WSUS · BitLocker · Event Viewer
    </p>

    <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> The new GPO infrastructure significantly improved system security, reduced manual configuration efforts, and enabled consistent policy enforcement across 500+ client and server machines. It played a critical role in the bank’s successful compliance audits and long-term IT governance.</p>
