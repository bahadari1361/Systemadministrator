          Enterprise Group Policy Implementation in Active Directory
        </h3>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-4">
          üìç Central Bank of Afghanistan &nbsp;|&nbsp; üóìÔ∏è March 2016 ‚Äì August 2021
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          I led the end-to-end design and deployment of a centralized <strong>Group Policy Object (GPO)</strong> architecture across the Central Bank of Afghanistan‚Äôs nationwide infrastructure. This project aimed to enforce security standards, improve manageability, and align with ISO/IEC 27001 compliance.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          I conducted a full audit of existing policies and organizational units, cleaned up deprecated objects, and built a structured and scalable GPO model based on best practices. This included tiered OU design, policy inheritance planning, and automation using PowerShell.
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-1">
          <li>Created and organized OUs for users, devices, and server roles</li>
          <li>Applied advanced security policies for passwords, lockouts, and user permissions</li>
          <li>Enforced <strong>BitLocker</strong> encryption on all endpoints</li>
          <li>Integrated <strong>WSUS</strong> for centralized patch management</li>
          <li>Disabled USB and removable media via GPO and registry rules</li>
          <li>Standardized desktop environments and enforced compliance with naming conventions</li>
          <li>Automated GPO backups and reporting using PowerShell scripts</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          I documented every policy with version tracking, linked policies to specific OUs with minimal inheritance issues, and mentored junior administrators on GPO troubleshooting and operational procedures.
        </p>

          <span class="font-semibold text-gray-800">Technologies Used:</span>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            Windows Server 2012 R2 / 2016, Active Directory, Group Policy Management Console (GPMC), PowerShell, WSUS, BitLocker

        <div>
          <span class="font-semibold text-gray-800">Outcome:</span>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            The project significantly increased IT operational efficiency, reduced manual administrative tasks by 40%, improved endpoint security posture, and ensured the organization passed multiple external audits with full compliance.
